# Pipefy Clone

This is a simple project for study made by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br) and you can watch the tutorial [
Recreating Pipefy from scratch (with drag n 'drop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awRtgpRsdTQ) in the YouTube channel.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Tech


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses open source porjects to work properly:

* [Yarn] - Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager.
* [ReactJS] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Styled Components] - Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
